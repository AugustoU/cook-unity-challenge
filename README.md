## Train of Thought

Modules that my backend app must have:
1. AuthModule : Module for users to register and authenticate in the application.
2. MealModule : Module to list and create meals based on the user's role.
3. MealRatingModule : Module to rate a meal and calculate its average rating based on the user's role.

[Quick mockup to outline how the views would be structured in the frontend.](frontend-mockup.drawio.png)

I will start by creating the AuthModule; for this, I will use AWS Cognito.
