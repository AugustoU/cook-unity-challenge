## Folder structure üìÅüìù

The solution is structured into modules, where each module has its presentation layer, services, entities, and DTOs.

- **auth:** Module to handle system authentication and authorization.
- **common**: Shared code, in this case, includes some DTOs for pagination purposes.
- **database**: Module to connect to PostgreSQL using TypeORM.
- **meal-ratings**: Module to manage meal ratings.
- **meals**: Module to manage meals.
- **users**: Module to manage users.
